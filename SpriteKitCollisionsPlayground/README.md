# Sprite Kit Collisions Playground

From https://github.com/jaredmpayne/SpriteKitCollisionsPlayground

This playground demonstrates how to perform physics collision detection using
Swift and Sprite Kit.

This playground was written using Swift 4 and Xcode 9. It covers creating
category bit masks and contact delegates to detect colliding physics bodies
during runtime.
